# Discover Cairo - HTML & CSS Travel Project  
This is a styled travel destination page created for my Web Development Basics course. The goal of this project was to build a clean, responsive single-page website using HTML and CSS to showcase a city Iâ€™d love to visit. The destination I chose is Cairo, Egypt.

## Features
- Semantic layout using `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Navigation bar with internal anchor links
- Custom Google Font (Playfair Display) for a polished title style
- Optimized WebP hero image, resized and compressed using Squoosh
- Testimonial quote styled with italics and background colour
- Travel pricing section with styled CTA button
- Icon-enhanced unordered list showing what's included in the travel package
- Footer with simple copyright and social media icons

## Getting Started
To view the page:
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts - Playfair Display
- Font Awesome - icons
- Squoosh - for image optimization and file format conversion
- GitHub Desktop for version control

## Notes
I kept this project simple and focused on layout, spacing, and basic styling without using any JavaScript or frameworks. I avoided advanced responsiveness or media queries to stay within the scope of the module. Small touches like icon lists, and layout cleanup were added for a more professional finish.
