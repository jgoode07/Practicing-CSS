        <h2>Why Visit Cairo?</h2>
        <p>
          Cairo is a vibrant city steeped in over a thousand years of history.
          From the ancient majesty of the Great Pyramids to the Islamic
          architecture of Old Cairo, the city offers a rich blend of cultural
          experiences. Wander through the bustling streets of Khan El Khalili,
          one of the Middle East’s oldest markets, where spices, perfumes, and
          hand-crafted treasures await.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nile River flows through the heart of Cairo, offering breathtaking
          sunset cruises and a peaceful escape from the city's hustle. You’ll
          find a modern metropolis rising beside timeless wonders: world-class
          museums, rooftop cafés with panoramic views, and a nightlife that
          rivals any global city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a history buff, a foodie, or an adventurer, Cairo
          delivers. Discover the awe of standing beneath the Sphinx, the beauty
          of Islamic domes glowing at dusk, and the warmth of Egyptian
          hospitality that turns every traveller into a storyteller.
